# <Week 3 Challenge - Password Generator>

## Description

Password generators are used to create strong randomized passwords. People tend to use the same password or a variation of it for everything! By doing so, this makes it easier for hackers to gain access to your accounts and personal information with less effort. By using a password generator, you can strengthen the security of your accounts and greatly reduce the risk of having them compromised. With this particular password generator, it is very user-friendly and allows you the choice to set certain criterias that you want for your password. This generator uses prompts and alert boxes to allow the user to quickly and efficiently set up their password based on their preference. The options available for the generated password include: the length of it and if it contains numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and/or special characters.
